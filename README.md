# Undergraduate Thesis Project
Title: `From Traditional to Explainable AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance`

Author: `amra2101`

## Overview

This repository contains all the source code and resources used for the experiments, model training, evaluation, and dataset preprocessing related to the thesis "From Traditional to Explainable AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance". The main focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of AI/ML models for predictive maintenance and enhancing transparency with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

> [!NOTE]
> The project has shifted away from the initial idea of using 2D/3D visualization.
> The prototypes below are therefore not representative of the final product.
